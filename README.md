# Simple Rule-Based Chatbot
This is a simple rule-based chatbot built using Python as part of my AI Internship with **CodSoft**.  
The chatbot can understand basic user inputs and respond with predefined answers. It serves as an introductory project to chatbot logic and Python programming.

# Features

- Greets the user
- Responds to common questions (like "how are you", "what's your name", etc.)
- Handles unknown inputs politely
- Exits on command (`exit` or `bye`)
- Fully written in Python with no external libraries
